## Setup voice recognition (Software)
Voice recognition work in 2 phases thanks to the [sonus](https://github.com/evancohen/sonus) module:
- First offline recognition of the hotwords "Hey lisa", nothing to do here it should work
- Then the next part use Google Speech API to recognize the voice command, Google API need a config file to work. 
 This file should be under `/var/www/lisa-box/config/speech/LISA-gfile.json`, to create this file please follow 
 [those steps](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/getting-started) and copy/paste/rename the file in the correct place.

## Setup voice recognition (Hardware)
### Matrix board
If you use the Matrix Board, you'll need to install more dependencies.
 
- Run `apt-get install matrix-creator-init matrix-creator-malos` 
- Edit the file `/etc/init.d/lisa` and uncomment the line `export AUDIODEV=mic_channel8`

### Other microphone
If you use another microphone, you need to add the correct value under the file `/etc/init.d/lisa`, uncomment the line `export AUDIODEV=mic_channel8` and change the value according to your microphone
